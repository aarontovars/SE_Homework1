# Software Engineering Homework 1

This repository contains the exercises solved of Homework 1 from the course Software Engineering in the 1st semester of MAIA program.

All the exercises are functions in the main code. For simplicity, the inputs of the functions are asked to the user instead of directly creating them.

## Exercise 1
Write a program which allows to compute area and circumference of a circle.

Inputs: radius of the circle

## Exercise 2
Write a function which allows to find the max and the min of a table.

Inputs: table (already created with random values)

## Exercise 3
Write a function which allows to compute the Fibonacci sequence.

Inputs: rank of the sequence

## Exercise 4
Write a function which allows to display in the terminal any multiplication table.

Inputs: number of the multiplication table

## Exercise 5
Write a function which allows to compute the truth table of AND or OR operators for a 3 input variable system.

Inputs: Either AND (0) or OR (1) truth table
